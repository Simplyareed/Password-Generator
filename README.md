# Password-Generator

## Description

The project that I have built is a randomized password generator. The reason that I have built this tool is to help the consumer who wishes to have a creative password.
This project was made with HTML,CSS, and Javascript. See source code for specific details pertaining to each.

- My motivation for this project was to show everything that I have learned in the previous weeks of learning Javascript, as well as showing how everything ties together from the beginning lessons that being over HTML and CSS. 

- The reason I built this project because I wanted to show that I can create a proper functioning website that is a helps users make a randomized password.

- Having a randomized password will make it difficult for anyone to gain access to their account due to the multiple variables that the consumer can choose from. This takes the hassle and stress that comes from thinking of a new password that you will have to remember and providing one for them.

- Working on this project expanded my knowledge of Javascript, working with functions and variables on a deeeper level. Using loops and booleans that all tie in to make the website run.

## Usage

When navigating to the site you will be presented with a generate password button. Once clicking generate password a series of prompts will follow asking if you wish to include certain characteristics about your password. If you wish to include them in your newly generated password then you may click "ok" otherwise you can click on "cancel". Afterwards you will receive an alert asking you how long you want your new password to be, to which you will enter the number and click okay. This will genereate your newly generated password, congratulations!
